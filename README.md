# Seasonal SIS model

by Kaloyan Danovski [kaloyan.danovski@gmail.com]

This work is part of a project in _MFS3 11925 Simulation Methods_, part of the Master in Physics of Complex Systems at IFISC.

The file `sis_fr.py` implements the baseline SIS model using the first-reaction method.

The file `sis_periodic.py` implements the seasonal SIS model using the Gillespie algorithm.

The file `plot_3d.py` was contains the code used to construct the plots in the report.
